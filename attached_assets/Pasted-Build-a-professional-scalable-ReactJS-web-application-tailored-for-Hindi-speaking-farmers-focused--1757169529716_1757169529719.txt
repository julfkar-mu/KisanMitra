Build a professional, scalable ReactJS web application tailored for Hindi-speaking farmers, focused on crops disease identification, remedies, and crop management guidance. The system should have the following key features and considerations:

Multilingual UI with Hindi as Default Language

Implement full Hindi language support using a robust internationalization library such as react-i18next.

Translate all UI text, crop categories, disease names, treatment instructions, seeding, watering info, and feedback prompts into clear, culturally appropriate Hindi.

Provide option to toggle between Hindi and English for accessibility.

Use Unicode fonts optimized for Devanagari script, ensuring crisp, readable Hindi text.

Design UI/UX that accommodates Hindi text length and script, with adequate spacing and font sizing for readability.

Home Page with Crop Categories

Display crop categories (e.g., sugarcane, wheat, rice) as visually appealing, clickable cards with high-quality images.

Card labels and image alt texts should be in Hindi.

Crop Category Page

Show detailed information about crop seeding, watering, and care instructions in Hindi.

List related crop diseases with summaries.

Each disease links to a dedicated disease detail page.

Disease Detail Page

Present detailed disease symptoms, causes, and stepwise treatment remedies in Hindi.

Include an enhanced image gallery supporting multiple high-resolution disease images.

The gallery should feature thumbnails, fullscreen view, and responsive swipe navigation for improved experience.

Feedback Collection

Embed a simple and accessible feedback form on crop category and disease pages for farmers to submit comments, ratings, and suggestions.

Feedback form UI texts and validations must be in Hindi.

Store feedback securely in the backend or cloud service.

Mobile Number + OTP Authentication

Integrate mobile number authentication with OTP verification using Firebase or a comparable service.

All auth prompts, warnings, and errors must be available in Hindi.

Ensure the login flow is intuitive and straightforward for non-technical users.

Admin Panel for Content Management

Develop an admin interface allowing content managers to add, update, or delete crop categories, diseases, images, and instructions.

Support bilingual content management with toggling between Hindi and English input.

Provide WYSIWYG editors capable of handling Devanagari script for rich text formatting.

Technical and UX Best Practices

Use modern React best practices with functional components, hooks, and context API or Redux for state management.

Employ react-router-dom for SPA navigation and clean URL management.

Lazy load images and optimize performance to accommodate low bandwidth environments typical in rural areas.

Conduct accessibility audits considering the target user base.

Implement responsive design ensuring smooth experience across all devices, especially mobiles.

Use form validation libraries (Formik/Yup) with localized error messages.

Include loading indicators and graceful error handling in Hindi.

Deliver the system with a modular, maintainable codebase that supports easy future extension to additional languages or crop data expansion. Prioritize user empathy, simplicity, and cultural relevance to drive adoption and trust among Hindi-speaking farmers.
